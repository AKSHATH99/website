I was responsible for designing detailed test plans, scenarios, and procedures that aligned with the project's functional requirements. My work involved executing comprehensive smoke, regression, and integration tests to validate the software's functionality and stability.\nA key aspect of my role was documenting and reporting software defects using industry-standard bug-tracking tools such as Jira and ClickUp. I collaborated closely with software developers, participating in product design reviews to provide input on functional requirements and proactively identify potential issues. I also monitored the progress of bug resolution efforts, ensuring timely and effective fixes.\nAdditionally, I conducted both positive and negative testing, ensuring thorough coverage of potential use cases. My contributions were instrumental in enhancing the software's performance and usability. Throughout this process, I utilized a variety of tools, including Postman for API testing, PowerShell for automation, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure to simulate diverse environments.\nThis experience not only deepened my expertise in software testing methodologies but also honed my problem-solving skills and my ability to thrive in a collaborative, fast-paced environment.","slug":"/Experience/techverx","date":"2024-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Quality Assurance","Testing","Automation","Jira","ClickUp","Selenium","API Testing","Postman","AWS","Azure"]},"html":"<h2>Contents</h2>\n<!-- - <a href=\"#what-i-learn\">What I learnt from Hywiz?</a> -->\n<p>-- <a href=\"#Quality-Assurance-Testing-Skills\">Quality Assurance &#x26; Testing Skills</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Automation-and-Tools\">Automation and Tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Collaboration-and-Communication\">Collaboration and Communication</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#problem-Solving\">Problem-Solving and Issue Resolution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Version-Control\">Version Control and Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Quality-Assurance-Testing-Skills\"> - Quality Assurance &#x26; Testing Skills:</h2>\n<p>Gained proficiency in creating comprehensive test cases, test plans, and executing tests like <strong>smoke, regression, integration,</strong> and <strong>functional testing</strong> to ensure the software met quality standards.</p>\n<p>Effectively utilized bug-tracking tools such as <strong>Jira</strong> and <strong>ClickUp</strong> to document, track, and prioritize issues, collaborating closely with developers to resolve defects promptly.</p>\n<p>Developed expertise in manual testing strategies, including both <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>negative testing</strong>, ensuring the software was robust against a wide range of use cases.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Automation-and-Tools\"> - Automation and Tools:</h2>\n<p>Incorporated automation tools like <strong>Selenium</strong> and <strong>PowerShell</strong> to increase the efficiency and coverage of testing efforts, ensuring more frequent and thorough testing.</p>\n<p>Performed <strong>API testing</strong> using tools like <strong>Postman</strong>, validating data consistency, response times, and system integration.</p>\n<p>Gained experience with cloud platforms such as <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Azure</strong>, setting up and configuring testing environments to replicate different user scenarios and environments.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Collaboration-and-Communication\"> - Collaboration and Communication:</h2>\n<p>Improved teamwork and communication skills through close collaboration with <strong>cross-functional teams</strong>, including software developers and project managers, ensuring seamless coordination in identifying and resolving defects.</p>\n<p>Actively participated in product design and sprint planning sessions, providing valuable feedback to enhance the quality and stability of the product.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"problem-Solving\"> - Problem-Solving and Issue Resolution:</h2>\n<p>Strengthened <strong>problem-solving skills</strong> by identifying critical issues early on, working with developers to address both functionality and performance bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>Leveraged analytical abilities to assess root causes of defects, implementing solutions that improved overall <strong>software reliability</strong>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Version-Control\"> - Version Control and Documentation:</h2>\n<p>Familiarized with version control systems like <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>, enhancing the ability to track, document, and revert changes effectively, contributing to improved development workflows.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hywiz Technologies","description":"During my 2-month internship at Hywiz Technologies, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the dynamic world of web development, where I contributed to the creation of cutting-edge web applications. This Experience allowed me to apply my technical skills and gain invaluable insights into the software development lifecycle. I focused on developing responsive web designs that not only met client requirements but also provided an exceptional user Experience across various devices.\nUtilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted engaging user interfaces and implemented interactive features using frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery. My role also involved collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, ensuring that design elements aligned with overall project goals and user needs. Additionally, I leveraged my C++ programming skills to implement algorithms that enhanced the efficiency of various application functions, further solidifying my problem-solving capabilities.\nThis internship not only refined my technical expertise but also fostered my ability to work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment, preparing me for future challenges in the ever-evolving field of software development.","slug":"/Experience/hywiz","date":"2023-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["C","C++","Html5","CSS","JavaScript","jQuery","Bootstrap","Git","GitHub"]},"html":"<h2>Contents</h2>\n<!-- - <a href=\"#what-i-learn\">What I learnt from Hywiz?</a> -->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#web-development\">Web Development skills</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#software-development\">Software Development Lifecycle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#User-Experience-Design\">User Experience Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Collaboration-and-Communication\">Collaboration and Communication</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#problem-Solving\">Problem-Solving and Algorithm Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Version-Control\">Version Control and Development Tools</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span id=\"what-i-learn\">What I learnt from Hywiz?</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"web-development\"> - Web Development Skills:</h3>\n<p>Enhanced proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing for the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>\n<p>Gained practical Experience in using Bootstrap and jQuery to develop responsive web designs that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"software-development\"> - Software Development Lifecycle:</h3>\n<p>Developed an understanding of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"User-Experience-Design\"> - User Experience Design:</h3>\n<p>Learned the importance of user-centered design principles, collaborating with design teams to ensure that web applications not only met technical requirements but also provided an exceptional user Experience.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Collaboration-and-Communication\"> - Collaboration and Communication:</h3>\n<p>Improved teamwork and communication skills by collaborating with cross-functional teams, gaining insights into how different roles contribute to project success.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"problem-Solving\"> - Problem-Solving and Algorithm Development:</h3>\n<p>Strengthened analytical and problem-solving skills by applying C++ programming knowledge to implement algorithms that optimized application performance and functionality.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Version-Control\"> - Version Control and Development Tools:</h3>\n<p>Familiarized with version control systems like Git, enhancing your ability to work collaboratively on code and manage changes effectively.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
